# Network Analysis Report
 
This project was completed for the Network Analysis (G0W14a) course at KU Leuven.

Task: analyze a longitudinal network dataset (which will be given to
you) with the studied methods, and compare the results from static
and dynamic models.

1a. What are the main characteristics of the friendship network at the
two observations? Are they similar/different?

1b. What are the relations between gender, drinking, and friendship in
wave 1? How do these change by wave 2?

2. Which micro patterns are important in explaining the structure of the
two friendship networks (separately)?

3. Which micro mechanisms shape the evolution of the friendship
network in your classroom?

4. State one hypothesis about other micro mechanisms which you
could test with the learnt methods.
